To hide traces
After I overdosed on pills, I understood there was some strange things going around me
Not only in my own head but also outside, as if some invisible mechanism synchronizes the thoughts and events around me
There's a connection between thoughts and what is happening around us.
At some point, there's some surety in my head, that this cannot be random, these events, and they're connected to what I think
I understood who I was in a past life.
At first, I inherited a miraculous ship that was able to transport souls, travel around the planet, and control reality.
How did I know that?
Events could be controlled (shamanism).

Prehistoric computer connects to a human body and is able to transmit thoughts, memories, emotions
It's also possible to control the growth of muscles, sustain the body, heal diseases, and promote the flow of living energy.
When a reincarnated human body reaches a certain point (inability to survive on its own), a superficially external force connects and fixes changes, promoting the proper flow of energy (calories from food, blood, other), but that does not comes without cost. It may lead to certain consequences, such as unfortunate events happening around us, and a change of destination in a program within God's mind.
